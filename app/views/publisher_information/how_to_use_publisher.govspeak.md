Content Publisher is a new way of publishing content on GOV.UK. It is designed to make it 
easier to publish useful content and to help you use data to manage that content.

We are now beta testing Content Publisher with government publishers. The beta version will have limited functionality at first. We are adding and improving features. 

Read more about [what Content Publisher can and cannot do](/beta-capabilities).

##How to create content

Content Publisher can be used to create news stories and press releases. Other document types still need to be created in Whitehall publisher.

You should always consider if content really needs to be published on GOV.UK. Unnecessary content makes it harder for users to find what they need.

Read [guidance on what to publish on GOV.UK](documents/publishing-guidance).

##Markdown

The body text can be formatted using markdown. Markdown uses special characters to indicate what text needs styling. For example, adding ## at the start of a line makes that line a heading.

Content publisher has a toolbar to make it easier to add common markdown. You can use the buttons to add headings, links, or lists. 

More advanced markdown features can be used by following the guidance and examples in the interface.

##Lead image

News content has a lead image which appears at the top of the page and is used as the thumbnail image on some links to the content. 

Every page has a default lead image to represent your organisation. You should replace it with a picture that is more relevant to the content.

You can upload any shape or size picture and crop it to the standard shape in Content Publisher. Image files can be jpg, gif, or png files.

You must add alt text for every image, but the caption is optional and the credit may not be required on all images.

You can upload several images but must pick the one you want to be the lead image.

##Tags

You should add tags that describe things the content is associated with. Tags help users find content on GOV.UK. 

Tags available include the organisations and ministers involved, and the locations the content is relevant to.

You only need to add any tags if they are relevant. If no minister is involved you don’t need to tag one.

---

##Topics

Topics describe what the content is about and group content on GOV.UK to make it easier to find. Topics are also known as the Taxonomy.

All content must be associated with at least one topic and can have as many as are relevant. Choose the most specific topics you can.

You can select any relevant topics. No topics are restricted or owned by any department.

Changes to topics are applied to a live page as soon as you save. If the content has already been published and you add new topics, then the last published edition will appear on those topic pages immediately, before you publish a new edition.

---

##How to update content

You can search for existing content using the document search.

To update published content you need to create a new edition. This new edition has the status ‘draft’ and can then be edited. When it's published it will replace the current edition live on GOV.UK.

When you publish a new edition you need to indicate what type of change you have made. If the change is significant to users you must add a change note to explain the change. This change note will appear on GOV.UK and will be emailed to users.

##How to publish content

###Preview

Before you publish content you must preview it. This shows you how the content will look on GOV.UK on a desktop screen and on a mobile screen. Half of our users are on a mobile device and so all content must be clear on small screens.

###Fact check or sign off

Some content needs to be checked before it is published to make sure it is accurate. 

You can share the content preview with others using the link provided so that they can see how it will look on GOV.UK.

The person you share it with can then ask you to make any corrections or changes.

###2i review

All content should be reviewed by another person before it's published. This is to make sure the content is easy to understand and there are no mistakes.

(2i is short for ‘2nd pair of eyes’, which means getting another person to review work.)

When you think content is ready to publish you should select ‘Submit for 2i review’. This will mark it as being ready to be checked and it will have the status ‘Submitted for 2i review’.

You then need to ask someone to do a 2i review. Send them the link to the page in Content publisher so that they can review it.

If they find any mistakes in the content then they can edit it or ask you to edit it.

When it has been reviewed and any improvements made, then either you or they can go ahead and publish it. 

Select the ‘Publish’ button, and then confirm that it has been reviewed. 

###2i review before Content publisher

The text may have been thoroughly reviewed before the document is created in Content publisher and the page prepared without any changes. If so it is possible to publish content without needing further review. 

Select the ‘Publish’ button, and then confirm that it has been reviewed. 

###Urgent publishing

Some content needs to be published urgently before it can be reviewed. This used to be known as ‘Force publishing’.

To publish urgently select the ‘Publish’ button, and then confirm that it should go live now but will still need review.

The content will go live on GOV.UK but will be marked in Content publisher with the status ‘Published but needs 2i review’.

You should send the Content publisher link to someone and ask them to review it.

If they find mistakes then they or you can update the content to fix them.

If there are no mistakes then they or you can select the ‘Approve’ button to confirm that the content has been reviewed. The content will then get the status ‘Published’.

##Featured documents

You can feature Content Publisher documents on organisation homepages. 

They will not appear in the main content search in Whitehall.

You need to use the option to 'Feature non-GOV.UK government link'. It is at the end of the page. This is the same way blog posts are featured. 

We have added document types for Content Publisher documents so that they appear just like Whitehall content.
