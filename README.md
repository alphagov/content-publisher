- [redis]() - provides a backing service for work queues

### Running the application

`./startup.sh`

Documentation for where the app will appear (default port, vhost, URL etc).

### Running the test suite

`bundle exec rake`

Include any other edge cases, e.g parallel test runner in Whitehall

### Any deviations from idiomatic Rails/Go etc. (optional)

### Example API output (optional)

`one-line-curl-command with JSON response after`
