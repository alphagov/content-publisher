# This list of content_ids is generated from Whitehall by running the following
# code in the Rails console:
# `puts Organisation.where(political: true).order(:name).map { |o| "- '#{o.content_id}' # #{o.name}" }.join("\n")`
# This is hardcoded in Content Publisher as this data is currently not
# represented in the Publishing API. This list will need to be updated if
# the political status of organisations are edited and in the long term
# should call the Publishing API
